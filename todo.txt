add permutation importance, partial dependencefe curves
add feature engineering for explainable models
refactor pca and lda plots together
make univariate pca nad lda plots maybe
think about train-test-split
benchmark plotting and easy classifier
add anyclassifier

if categorical encoded as float (even int) like chas variable, imputation fails with dabl_missing which is a string.

FIXME integers need to be considered continuous again in preprocessor? duplicate columns? hmmm
we need to think about this!

types are different for feature engineering and visualization.
try to convert floats to ints as well?

# NEW? where's the other one?! damn...

only plot pdp if few classes, otherwise restrict to user-specified classes

calibration plots

select pdp plot features by some measure of variable importance?

refactor finding "interesting features" in a model-agnostic way?

partial dependence plot can't take advantage of fast method for now :(
