Welcome to dabl, the Data Analysis Baseline Library
===================================================

This project tries to help make supervised machine learning more accessible for
beginners, and reduce boiler plate for common tasks.

This library is in very active development, so it's not recommended for production use.

Development at `github.com/amueller/dabl <https://github.com/amueller/dabl>`_.
