Machine Learning with dabl
==================================================

Philosophy
----------
The idea behind dabl is to jump-start your supervised learning task.  dabl has
several tools that make it easy to clean and inspect your data, and create
strong baseline models.

Building machine learning models is an inherently iterative task with a human
in the loop.  Big jumps in performance are often achieved by better
understanding of the data and task, and more appropriate features.  dabl tries
to provide as much insight into the data as possible, and enable interactive
analysis.

Many analyses start with the same rote tasks of cleaning and basic data
visualization, and initial modeling.  dabl tries to make these steps as easy
as possible, so that you can spend your time thinking about the problem and
creating more interesting custom analyses.

There are two main packages that dabl takes inspiration from and that dabl
builds upon: scikit-learn and auto-sklearn.  The design philosophies and
use-cases are quite different, however.

Scikit-learn provides many essential building blocks, but is built on the idea
to do exactly what the user asks for.  That requires specifying every step of
the processing in detail.  dabl on the other hand has a best-guess philosophy:
it tries to do something sensible, and then provides tools for the user to
inspect and evaluate the results to judge them.

auto-sklearn is completely automatic and black-box.  It searches a vast space
of models and constructs complex ensemles of high accuracy, taking a substantial
amount of computation and time in the process.  The goal of auto-sklearn is to
build the best model possible given the data.  dabl, conversely, tries to enable
the user to quickly iterate and get a grasp on the properties of the data at hand
and the fitted models.

dabl is meant to support you in the following tasks, in order:

Data cleaning
-------------
>>> import dabl
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> data = pd.read_csv(dabl.datasets.data_path("adult.csv.gz"))
>>> data_clean = dabl.clean(data)[::10]

The first step in any data analysis is data cleaning. dabl tries to detect the
types of your data and apply appropriate conversions.  It also tries to detect
potential data quality issues.
The field of data cleaning is impossibly broad, and dabl's approaches are by no
means sophisticated.  The goal of dabl is to get the data "clean enough" to
create useful visualizations and models, and to allow users to perform
custom cleaning operations themselves.
In particular if the detection of semantic types (continuous, categorical,
ordinal, text, etc) fails, the user can provide ``type_hints``:

>>> data_clean = dabl.clean(data, type_hints={"capital-gain": "continuous"})

Exploratory Data analysis
-------------------------
>>> dabl.plot(data, target_col="income")
Target looks like classification
Linear Discriminant Analysis training set score: ...


The next step in any task should be exploratory data analysis. dabl provides a
high-level interface that summarizes several common high-level plots.  For low
dimensional datasets, all features are shown; for high dimensional datasets,
only the most informative features for the given task are shown.  This is
clearly not guaranteed to surface all interesting aspects with the data, or to
find all data quality issues.  However, it will give you a quick insight in to
what are the important features, their interactions, and how hard the problem
might be.  It also allows a good assessment of whether there is any data
leakage through spurious representations of the target in the data.

The SimpleClassifier first tries several baseline and instantaneous models,
potentially on subsampled data, to get an idea of what a low baseline should be.
This again is a good place to surface data leakage, as well as find the main
discriminative features in the dataset.  The ``SimpleClassifier`` allows
specifying data in the scikit-learn-style ``fit(X, y)`` with a 1d y and
features ``X``, or with ``X`` being a dataframe and specifying the target
column inside of X as ``target_col``.

The SimpleClassifier also performs preprocessing such as missing value
imputation and one-hot encoding.  You can inspect the model using:

>>> dabl.explain(ec) # doctest: +SKIP

This can lead to additional insights and guide custom processing and
cleaning of the data.

Enhanced Model Building
------------------------
>>> # ac = AnyClassifier().fit(data, target_col="income") not implemented yet

After creating an initial model, it's interesting to explore more powerful
models such as tree ensembles.  ``AnyClassifier`` searches over a space of
models that commonly perform well, and identifies promising candidates.  If
your goal is prediction, ``AnyClassifier`` can provide a strong baseline for
further investigation.  Again, we can inspect our model to understand it
better:

>>> # explain(ac)


Explainable Model Building
---------------------------
TODO this is not done yet!

Sometimes, explainability of a model can be more important than performance. A
complex model can serve as a good benchmark on what is achievable on a certain
dataset. After this benchmark is established, it is interesting to see if we
can build a model that is interpretable while still providing competitive
performance.

>>> # xc = ExplainableClassifier().fit(data, target_col="income")


.. include:: ./successive_halving.rst


Limitations
-----------
Right now dabl does not deal with text data and time series data.  It also does
not consider neural network models.  Image, audio and video data is considered
out of scope.  All current implementation are quite rudimentary and rely
heavily on heuristics. The goal is to replace these with more principled
approaches where this provides a benefit.


Future Goals and Roadmap
-------------------------
dabl aims to provide easy-to-use, turn-key solutions for supervised machine
learning that strongly encourage iterative and interactive model building.
Key ingedients to achieve this are:

- Ready-made visualizations
- Model diagnostics
- Efficient model search
- Type detection
- Automatic preprocessing
- Portfolios of well-performing pipelines

The current version of dabl only provides very simple implementations of these,
but the goal is for dabl to contain more advanced solutions while providing a
simple user interface and strong anytime performance.
