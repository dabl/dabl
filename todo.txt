add permutation importance, partial dependence curves
add regression
add feature engineering for explainable models
rename SimpleClassifier to SimpleClassifier
refactor pca and lda plots together
make univariate pca nad lda plots maybe
add regression
think about train-test-split
benchmark plotting and easy classifier
add anyclassifier

if categorical encoded as float (even int) like chas variable, imputation fails with dabl_missing which is a string.

FIXME integers need to be considered continuous again in preprocessor? duplicate columns? hmmm
we need to think about this!

types are different for feature engineering and visualization.
try to convert floats to ints as well?
